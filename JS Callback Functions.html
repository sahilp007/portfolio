		<h1>How to Use JavaScript Callback Functions</h1>
		
		<p>
			You’ve probably seen a few code snippets use the word “callback” inside a function. Callbacks are a special
			type
			of function that are passed inside another function.<br><br>
			Callbacks are often used inside event handlers to run a block of code. In this guide, we’re going to talk
			about
			what callback functions are and how they work. We’ll walk through an example of a callback function to help
			you
			learn how to use them in your code.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2> What is a Callback Function? </h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			A callback function is a function that is passed as a parameter into another function.
			<br><br>
			Callback functions are run within the function in which they are declared. When you execute a function, its
			callback function, if one is specified, will execute. Once it has run, the callback function will return a
			response to the main function.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Callback functions work because in JavaScript, every function is an object. This means that we can work with
			them like any other object. We can assign functions to variables, or pass them as arguments, just like we
			would
			with any other value.
			<br><br>
			Let’s use a simple example to show how callbacks work. We’re going to create a function which prints out a
			user’s name for a video game to the console, followed by their character type. Let’s start by declaring a
			function:
			<br><br>
			<span class="snippets">function printName(name, callback) {<br>
			console.log(`Player Name: ${name}`);<br>
			callback();<br>
			}</span><br>
			<br>
			This is an anonymous JavaScript function which contains a callback. Anonymous functions are functions
			without a
			name. They usually appear inside other functions, like in the example above.
			<br>
			This callback is the second parameter in our code. When this function is run, the name of our player is
			printed
			to the console. Then, the contents of our callback() function are executed.
			<br>
			<span class="snippets">Now, let’s use this function:<br>
			
			printName("Violet", function() {<br>
			console.log("Character Type: Mage");<br>
			})</span><br>
			
			We have called our function printName() in this code. We have specified “Violet” as the player’s name. We
			have
			specified a function which prints out the character type as the callback. Let’s run this code and see what
			happens:
			<br><br>
			Player Name: Violet
			<br>
			Character Type: Mage
			<br><br>
			The contents of the printName() function are executed, followed by the contents of our callback function.
			Callback functions do not need to be declared when you are passing them as a parameter. We could refactor
			our
			code so that our callback function is on its own:<br>
			<br>
			<span class="snippets">function printCharacterType() {<br>
			console.log("Character Type: Mage");<br>
			}<br>
			printName("Violet", printCharacterType())</span>
			<br><br>
			This code will return the same response. We have created a function called printCharacterType() which prints
			the
			character type of a player to the console. This function is executed when we run printName(), as it is
			specified
			as a callback.
